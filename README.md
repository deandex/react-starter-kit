React Starter Kit — web app boilerplate
=======================================

Quick start project template for projects and learning React.

### Objective

React Starter Kit is an web app boilerplate for all our client projects.<br />
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Usage
**Clone this repository**
```
git clone git@github.com:deandex/react-starter-kit.git
```

**Install**
```
npm install
```

**Start the application in development mode**
```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Static files are served from the `public` folder, project JavaScript files are bundled from the `src` folder.

**When ready, build for staging**
```
npm run build:staging
```

This will generate a minimized bundle.js file on the `public` folder, and use staging environment

**When ready, build for production**
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a minimized bundle.js file on the `public` folder, and use production environment

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
